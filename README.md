#### Day 1 (July 6th, 2021)
I'm excited to expand my skills in Python and use some AI knowledge to work on a project with my group. I hope to make use of these skills when developing projects for the Create-A-Thon during the summer.

#### Day 2 (July 7th, 2021)
I learned so much from the Leadership Seminar from David Kong and learned how to formulate and share a story by describing the experience I had as well as formulting it in a way that allows others to feel the same way I did during that experience.

#### Day 3 (July 8th, 2021)
I was able to hear some challenging experiences that some might face during their lives and learned how to come up with a plan or solution to help accomodate for those challenges and to discuss those solutions with other peers.

#### Day 8 (July 13th, 2021)

I learned about Neural Networks and its bulding blocks and how it relates to the human brain and how it can be used to predict how most humans would try and behave.

#### Day 9 (July 14th, 2021)

I learned about convolutional neural networks and how its used for images since each image is amatrix of pixel values and was able to dive into a topic that I had been unfamiliar with at first.

#### Day 10 (July 15th, 2021)

I learned about the types of biases and considerations for even the most non-biased of AI algorithms because they might favor certain results over another and how we can spot and respond to such biases.

#### Day 15 (July 20th, 2021)

I listened to Daniel Ranallo discuss his view on the importance of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and realized the possibilities and growth of such a field in the future where technology is becoming increasingly important and will guide much of our lives.

#### Day 17 (July 22nd, 2021)
I learned about imaage classification and some of the tools that could be used but also encountered and learned some significant challenges that were possible with image  classification such as the illumination or viewpoint variation that would make it harder.

#### Day 22 (July 27th, 2021)
I was able to get a grasp on building my profile and resume and I also was able to learn networking skills to help let others know about my skills and to get more involved to apply some of my skills in a real-world environment where I would be working on a project with a team.
