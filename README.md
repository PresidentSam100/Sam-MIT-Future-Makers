## Responses
#### Day 1 (July 6th, 2021)
Reflect: I'm excited to expand my skills in Python and use some AI knowledge to work on a project with my group. I hope to make use of these skills when developing projects for the Create-A-Thon during the summer.

Lessons: I don't have any specific skills that I want to learn, but I want to get an idea of the AI field and getting to know about this during the summer.

#### Day 2 (July 7th, 2021)
Reflect: I learned so much from the Leadership Seminar from David Kong and learned how to formulate and share a story by describing the experience I had as well as formulating it in a way that allows others to feel the same way I did during that experience. 

Lesson: More specifically, I recognized that when talking about oneself, I should talk about a challenge that I experienced and how I solved it, and something that I took away from the experience. By doing so, it allows me to recognize that any contribution, even the smallest, can have a significant impact, and help engage others in getting involved too.

#### Day 3 (July 8th, 2021)
Reflect: I was able to hear some challenging experiences that some might face during their lives and learned how to come up with a plan or solution to help accommodate for those challenges and to discuss those solutions with other peers.

Lesson: Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two specific types of machine learning, but the key difference between them lies in whether you have to "supervise" them. In particular, supervised learning takes in data and learns from that feedback such as classification models, but unsupervised learning only learns from input data and uses patterns such as a cluster model. Even though Scikit-learn can't produce visualizations on its own, other libraries such as matplotlib can help with that.

#### Day 4 (July 9th, 2021)
Reflect: I learned about the differences between Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), and I also learned about CPUs, and other processing units I had never even heard of before such as TPUs and GPUs.

Lesson: One real-world problem that is common especially with technology is the hacking of passwords especially if similar passwords are used between accounts associated with the same user. This is a problem because by doing so, certain accounts are more vulnerable and significant amounts of crucial data and information can be leaked.

Dataset: One dataset I found from Kaggle demonstrates how poor password safety can be a problem (https://www.kaggle.com/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt)

#### Day 7 (July 12th, 2021)

Reflect: I learned about Neural Networks and its building blocks and how it relates to the human brain and how it can be used to predict how most humans would try and behave. I also learned more about the Tensorflow, Keras, and Pandas libraries.

Lesson: Tensors store data in a way similar to matrices but can be any dimension, unlike matrices which are 2 dimensional. Tensors can be scalar (0 dimensions), vector (1 dimension), matrix (2 dimensions), or anything greater. However, most tensors are generally used with more dimensions.

Observation: Something interesting I discovered is that TensorFlow is constantly updating and new features can make older ones obsolete. In addition, there were many different functions that each library can do such as creating a graph of data or creating a simple neural network.

#### Day 8 (July 13th, 2021)

Reflect: I had already had some idea on what activation functions were like

Lesson: I learned about Neural Networks and its building blocks and how it relates to the human brain and how it can be used to predict how most humans would try and behave. Neural networks

#### Day 9 (July 14th, 2021)

I learned about convolutional neural networks and how it's used for images since each image is a matrix of pixel values and was able to dive into a topic that I had been unfamiliar with at first.

#### Day 10 (July 15th, 2021)

I learned about the types of biases and considerations for even the most non-biased of AI algorithms because they might favor certain results over another and how we can spot and respond to such biases.

#### Day 11 (July 16th, 2021)

Reflection: I learned about the types of biases and considerations for even the most non-biased of AI algorithms because they might favor certain results over another and how we can spot and respond to such biases.

#### Day 15 (July 20th, 2021)

I listened to Daniel Ranallo discuss his view on the importance of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and realized the possibilities and growth of such a field in the future where technology is becoming increasingly important and will guide much of our lives.

#### Day 16 (July 21th, 2021)

Reflection:

Lesson:

#### Day 17 (July 22nd, 2021)
I learned about image classification and some of the tools that could be used but also encountered and learned some significant challenges that were possible with image classification such as the illumination or viewpoint variation that would make it harder.

#### Day 22 (July 27th, 2021)
I was able to get a grasp on building my profile and resume and I also was able to learn networking skills to help let others know about my skills and to get more involved to apply some of my skills in a real-world environment where I would be working on a project with a team.
