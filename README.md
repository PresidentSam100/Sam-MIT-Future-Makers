#### Day 1 (July 6th, 2021)
I'm excited to expand my skills in Python and use some AI knowledge to work on a project with my group. I hope to make use of these skills when developing projects for the Create-A-Thon during the summer.

#### Day 2 (July 7th, 2021)
I learned so much from the Leadership Seminar from David Kong and learned how to formulate and share a story by describing the experience I had as well as formulting it in a way that allows others to feel the same way I did during that experience.

#### Day 3 (July 8th, 2021)
I was able to hear some challenging experiences that some might face during their lives and learned how to come up with a plan or solution to help accomodate for those challenges and to discuss those solutions with other peers.
